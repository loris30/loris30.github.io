### T17
Search on the web about possible derivation of the Normal Distribution.










### T18
Search on the web about method to generate normal variate (eg Marsaglia method, etc.)






### A12

Consider R (radius), A(angle) uniform rv's and use them as random polar coordinates on a plane.
Determine the empirical distribution of the corresponding Cartesian coordinates (X,Y).

### A13
Search for the methods to generate Normal rv's X from uniform rv's, and simulate the following distribution: X, X², X/Y², X²/Y², X/Y .
Researches about theory relevant to applications (TA)





### TA7
Find in the web what are the distributions that you just simulated.
