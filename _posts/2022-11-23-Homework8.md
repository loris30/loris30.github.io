### T17
Search on the web about possible derivation of the Normal Distribution.

The Normal Distribution is derived from the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sampling distribution of the mean of any independent, randomly selected group of a large size will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the shape of the population distribution from which the sample is drawn. The theorem explains why the Normal Distribution is so important in statistics. It is used to model the probability of different outcomes in a wide variety of situations.



### T18
Search on the web about method to generate normal variate (eg Marsaglia method, etc.)
The Marsaglia method is a method for generating pseudorandom numbers developed by George Marsaglia in the 1960s. The method works by combining two existing random number generators, and then using that combination to generate a new set of numbers. The method is popular because it is efficient and can produce high-quality random numbers. The method is also relatively simple to implement.


The Marsaglia polar method is a pseudo-random number sampling method for generating a pair of independent standard normal variables. The polar method is a 4-step algorithm:

Generate two independent, equally distributed random numbers u and v in the interval [-1,1]
Evaluate q=u2+v2. If q=0 or q⩾1, go back to step 1


Evaluate

and  are now two independent, standard normally distributed random numbers.
The point (u,v) must be in the unit circle (q<1) and it must be q>0 because the real numbers do not define ln(0) and the division by 0





### A12
Consider R (radius), A(angle) uniform rv's and use them as random polar coordinates on a plane.
Determine the empirical distribution of the corresponding Cartesian coordinates (X,Y).

### A13
Search for the methods to generate Normal rv's X from uniform rv's, and simulate the following distribution: X, X², X/Y², X²/Y², X/Y .

### TA7
Find in the web what are the distributions that you just simulated.

1. The Inverse Transform Method: This method involves transforming a uniform random variable into a normal random variable. It works by inverting the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the desired distribution.
2. The Box-Muller Transform: This method works by generating two independent standard normally distributed random variables from two independent uniformly distributed random variables.
3. Rejection Sampling: This method involves generating a uniform random variable and checking to see if it falls within the desired normal distribution. If it does, it is accepted, otherwise it is rejected.
4. Central Limit Theorem: This method involves taking the average of several independent random variables with a mean and variance of 0 and 1, respectively. This average will tend to follow a normal distribution as the number of variables increases.

The random polar coordinates in a plane can be represented by (r, θ) where r is the distance from the origin (0, 0) and θ is the angle measured from the positive x-axis. Examples of random polar coordinates in a plane could be (5, 45°), (6, 120°), (3, 270°), (4, 325°), etc.
