### T7
Illustrate the parallels, between the properties of the relative frequency and the axioms for probability
### T8: 
Discuss some concrete examples of Probability measure Space
### T9: 
Illustrate how Measure Theory provides the mathematical foundation for Probability Theory
What is the definition of statistics?

### Answers:
### T7: 
Before understanding the concept of probability, we defined, in the previous lecture, the concept of relative frequency of a value of a certain attribute. We defined the univariate distribution and the multivariate distribution and we also defined the concept of marginal and conditional relative frequency. We started with a statistical units, then we performed a survay on the statistical units, we stored in a table some attributes to create a certain distribution and then with this value we can perform the absolute frequency of a certain characteristics, the relative frequency of a certain characteristics and so on. About of the conditional frequency, we can also explain this concept in an abstract way:

### T8: 
Dataset is the result of collocation of data, object of statistical analysis, the set of object you want to describe is statistical population. It can be described as a set of data organized in relational form. It has a tabular structure, where usually each columns represents a variable (also called statistical variable) and each rows corresponds to an observation (also called attribute).
Attribute is a quality of an object (person, thing, etc.). As an example for a student thare are possible attributes sucj as gender, age, sports etc. A variable is the set of all possible value that an attribute can take.
Statistics c an be used in different fields of our life. In marketing, statistics include conversion rates, social media metrics. In IT, statistics include bandwidth, network capabilities, and hardware logistics, cybersecurity. In human resources, statistics include employee turnover, employee satisfaction, and average compensation relative to the market.

### T9: 
Statistics in Cybersecurity:
Calculation of cost of cybercrime: [The Cost Of Cybercrime] (https://purplesec.us/resources/cyber-security-statistics/#Cybercrime)

SIEM Statistics: A Security Information and Event Monitoring solution (SIEM) aggregates log and event data from an exponentially-growing number of data sources across the infrastructure (applications, network and endpoint security tools, cloud monitoring tools, identity providers, etc.). This data is then analyzed using predefined threat detection rules and queries to identify suspicious or unauthorized behavior (https://purplesec.us/resources/cyber-security-statistics/#SIEM)

Statistics and Cyber Threat Intelligence: investigating the relationship between two variables, for example, malware and adversary. Correlation in threat intelligence helps identify links between pieces of information.  Conditional probability helps not only understanding your data, but also coming up with actionable insights. Conditional probability looks at two or more dependent events. For example, the probability of a successful exploit of vulnerability X enabling a successful spear phishing attack on company Y.

## Applications
### A1: 
Create a simple application in C# and VB.NET to play with handlers and to understand syntax differences between them two.
The proposed solution is in the ZIP file that can be found at [this GitHub link](https://github.com/loris30/StatisticsHomework/).

## Research on app
### TA1 
What are the main differences between C# and VB.NET?
Visual Basic .NET is a high-level programming language that was initially developed in 1991. It was the first programming language that directly supported programming graphical user interfaces using language-supplied objects. It supports all the concepts of an object-oriented such as object, class, encapsulation, etc.
C# is commonly pronounced as C-sharp. It is the object-oriented programming language that is run on the .NET framework. This language is developed by Microsoft. Various kinds of applications can be easily created by using this language. For example Mobile applications and game development 
(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-vb-net-and-c-sharp/)

VB uses the keyword Me to refer to the Form object; C#, instead, uses the keyword “this“;
In conditional statements, VB uses a single equal symbol (=), while C# used the most common double equal symbol (==);
To concatenate strings, VB net uses the & symbol; C#, instead, uses the + symbol;
VB doesn’t uses curly brackets, while C# uses them.
VB uses PascalCase as a naming convention, while C# uses camelCase;
Whilst C# uses semicolons ; at the end of statements, VB does not.
