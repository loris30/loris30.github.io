Try to understand the general idea of the Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral and why it is useful concept and notation in Theory of Probability

The Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral is a generalization of the Riemann-Stieltjes integral which is used to integrate functions with respect to a non-decreasing, real-valued function. This integral is used to integrate functions that are not necessarily continuous or differentiable such as the Dirac delta function. 

Lebesgue integration is an alternative way of defining the integral in terms of measure theory that is used to integrate a much broader class of functions than the Riemann integral or even the Riemann-Stieltjes integral. The idea behind the Lebesgue integral is that instead of approximating the total area by dividing it into vertical strips, one approximates the total area by dividing it into horizontal strips. This corresponds to asking "for each yy-value, how many xx-values produce this value?" as opposed to asking "for each xx-value, what yy-value does it produce?"
Because the Lebesgue integral is defined in a way that does not depend on the structure of \mathbb{R}R, it is able to integrate many functions that cannot be integrated otherwise. Furthermore, the Lebesgue integral can define the integral in a completely abstract setting, giving rise to probability theory.

The Lebesgue integral works by calculating the value of an integral based on y-values instead of x-values

This graph consists of two line segments, so the area under it can be thought of as two rectangles, so the integral has value

Explain in your own words the "Law of large numbers" and sketch a simple proof (Markov inequality, Čebyšëv inequality, ... )



### A11
Consider a general scheme ad the simulation of previous homework and simulate the distribution of p = SUM(xi) , where xi are Bernoulli(lambda/n), with success probability lambda /n, where lambda is a user constant ("arrival rate").
Also plot the distribution of the "interarrival times".
Finally, search on the web to understand what you have actually simulated
