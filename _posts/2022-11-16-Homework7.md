Try to understand the general idea of the Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral and why it is useful concept and notation in Theory of Probability

The Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral is a generalization of the Riemann-Stieltjes integral which is used to integrate functions with respect to a non-decreasing, real-valued function. This integral is used to integrate functions that are not necessarily continuous or differentiable such as the Dirac delta function. 

Lebesgue integration is an alternative way of defining the integral in terms of measure theory that is used to integrate a much broader class of functions than the Riemann integral or even the Riemann-Stieltjes integral. The idea behind the Lebesgue integral is that instead of approximating the total area by dividing it into vertical strips, one approximates the total area by dividing it into horizontal strips. This corresponds to asking "for each yy-value, how many xx-values produce this value?" as opposed to asking "for each xx-value, what yy-value does it produce?"
Because the Lebesgue integral is defined in a way that does not depend on the structure of \mathbb{R}R, it is able to integrate many functions that cannot be integrated otherwise. Furthermore, the Lebesgue integral can define the integral in a completely abstract setting, giving rise to probability theory.

The Lebesgue integral works by calculating the value of an integral based on y-values instead of x-values

This graph consists of two line segments, so the area under it can be thought of as two rectangles, so the integral has value

When we use the Riemann integral though, we're actually thinking about this slightly differently: we're drawing many smaller rectangles, and using them to "approximate" the large rectangles, although in this case the approximation is exact.

In this case, the distinction between the two ways of thinking about the area is meaningless, but as the following example shows, this is not always the case.


If we try to use the Riemann integral here, because every interval contains infinitely many rational and irrational numbers, the graph of this function cannot be approximated by rectangles, so the area cannot be calculated using the Riemann integral. But using the perspective of the Lebesgue integral, since ff takes only two values, 0 and 1, all we need to do is to think about the size of the sets on which it's taking those values and then multiply by the appropriate values.

There are only countably many rationals and uncountably many irrationals, so the measure of the rationals in (0,1)(0,1) is 0, and the measure of the irrationals is 1. Since ff takes a value of 1 at the rationals, they contribute 0\cdot 1=00⋅1=0 to the integral; similarly, the irrationals contribute 1\cdot 0=01⋅0=0. 
Thus the value of the integral is 0. _\square

Explain in your own words the "Law of large numbers" and sketch a simple proof (Markov inequality, Čebyšëv inequality, ... )



### A11
Consider a general scheme ad the simulation of previous homework and simulate the distribution of p = SUM(xi) , where xi are Bernoulli(lambda/n), with success probability lambda /n, where lambda is a user constant ("arrival rate").
Also plot the distribution of the "interarrival times".
Finally, search on the web to understand what you have actually simulated
